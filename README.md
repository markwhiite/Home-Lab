**Purpose**
- The purpose of my virtual home-lab is to create a safe environment for practicing cybersecurity , IT operations, and networking. 
My setup includes an old pc, multiple VMs, network segmentation, many virtualization tools, and creating attack/defense scenarios.
- **Tools Used:** Host Machine (windows),  Kali Linux (attacker), VirtualBox, Ubuntu (server)

**Home Lab Scenario**
- I have been contracted to the company "Mark Estates" and will be in charge of their IT infrastructure and systems.
- They currently have 50 employees connected to a workgroup network
    - They have no central file shares or storage
    - No backups
    - No monitoring or AV
    - No user management
    - No Firewalls
    - Nothingâ€¦
- My goal is to implement these aspects, harden the network and devices, monitor and defend the network
- I will use this Lab topology  in many of my projects
