- The image above takes a look at the **network topology** I have created for this scenario. To the left are the **virtual servers** that I will set up which include an Email server, Windows server
that will run programs like Active Directory, Domain Controller, DNS, Along with the Ubuntu Server and an Elastic search stack. Furthermore, I will install a **OPN sense next generation fire wall**,
along with a **Windows 10 client** and **Kali Linux machine**. All of these devices will be connected to a **virtual layer two switch** using Virtual Box.
- I will use this network topology for many of my projects

**Home Lab Scenario**

- I have been contracted to the company "Mark Estates" and will be in charge of their IT infrastructure and systems.
They currently have 50 employees connected to a workgroup network
- They have no central file shares or storage
  - No backups
  - No monitoring or AV
  - No user management
  - No Firewalls
  - Nothingâ€¦
- My goal is to implement these aspects, harden the network and devices, monitor and defend the network
- I will use this Lab topology in many of my projects
